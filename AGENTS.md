## Agent skills
This repo uses jhste skills as shared guidance.
Repo-local instructions in this file remain authoritative.
File, repo, command, issue, PR, or other external side effects are allowed when the user directly requested that workflow or repo-local standing approval covers it.
Ask for destructive, irreversible, ambiguous, production, secret, cost-bearing, broad existing-item, or out-of-scope changes.
For reversible in-scope choices, make a reasonable assumption, proceed, and report it in the final summary.
See `.jhste/profile.yaml` for local skill preferences.
Before non-trivial code changes, use the `jhste-engineering-groundwork` skill to check scope, boundaries, failure paths, and assumptions.
For changed code, name the one main responsibility of each changed class, module, and function, and reject adjacent responsibilities unless they are on the changed execution path and prevent a concrete failure.
Use SOLID-informed coding discipline as a review lens, not a compliance claim; guard findings are review candidates, not proof.
After code changes, run `jhste-skills guard --scope changed --format text --fail-on error` when available.
Report guard warnings/errors; do not treat guard runtime/config failures as validation success.
Treat guard output as review evidence, not proof by itself.
If guard or red-team review reports new warnings on changed files, attempt a bounded fix before declaring completion, then rerun guard. Do not commit automatically.
Before declaring non-trivial code work complete, use the `jhste-red-team-review` skill.
Skip red-team review for docs-only, comment-only, formatting-only, or trivial rename-only changes.
Do not enter an unbounded fix/review loop; stop after at most two fix + re-review cycles and report remaining risks.

## Secrets and env

- Do not print, commit, or document the real value of tokens, API keys, passwords, cookies, or other secrets.
- If a user asks to input, replace, rotate, sync, or apply a token/API key/secret, perform the operation when the workflow is otherwise allowed; do not refuse merely because the task touches a secret.
- Keep the secret value itself out of responses, logs, commits, and docs. When confirmation is needed, report only the key name, destination, status, or a masked hint.
